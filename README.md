## Overview
To fortify the proposal to create a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, we analyzed a comparable business currently operating in New York, NY: Citi Bike. We looked for trends in usage by gender, user type, time of day, and day of the week for the month of August in the year 2019.

## Results

- Heaviest usage occurs during rush hour on weekdays. This suggests that many users rely on the bike-sharing program to commute.
  - Weekly commuters are likely to comprise the largest proportion of service Subscribers.
- Lowest usage occurs between 10PM and 4AM. This timeframe would be appropriate for scheduled bike maintenance.

- The majority of rides last fewer than 20 minutes, regardless of the user's Gender or Type.
- Bike-sharing is ideal for a city environment, where destinations are relatively close together. However, a large number of stations must be available for the model to be viable.

- This heatmap tracks the starting locations for Citi Bike users in New York. Where office buildings and tourist attractions abound, usage soars.

## Summary
Bike-sharing, like other forms of public transportation, is most viable in densely populated areas. Citi Bike usage trends from August 2019 in New York, NY suggest that similar business models would do well to place bike stops at regular intervals on city blocks, particularly in high traffic areas like tourist destinations and office hubs. Subscription programs should target individuals who consistently require public transportation, but desire a more independent form of travel. Heaviest usage came from the Male Subscriber demographic, who most likely rely on Citi Bike for their weekly commutes. Diversification of the user base could do great things for revenue.

With these trends in mind, the next step would be to identify pilot locations in Des Moines. Analysis of existing public transportation routes, population density, school locations, and notable attractions in the city should should be taken into consideration. Further analysis of New York's trends by age and ethnic groups could also aid in ad campaign strategy.
